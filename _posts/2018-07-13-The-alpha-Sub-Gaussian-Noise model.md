The wait is finally over! Find the αSGN(m) toolbox for Matlab at https://github.com/ahmd-mahm/alpha-SGNm. 

In 2015, we at the ARL (NUS) proposed the αSGN(m) model to characterize snapping shrimp noise. The model does not only characterize the impulsive statistics of the noise process, but its memory or "burstiness" as well.  Over time, we have developed several algorithms within the αSGN(m) framework. These were shown to improve upon performances of underwater acoustic systems operating in snapping shrimp noise. For the related literature, seek out my publications page.

The toolbox is now out! Go ahead and test the above assertions. Validate the model in whatever way you deem appropriate. Let's understand our oceans, one step at a time! Enjoy! 😉
